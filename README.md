# COVID-19 DK
COVID-19 models used by the SSI modelling group. Each model (component) is in their own folder.

## C19REST030
This folder contains the model used for the [report](https://files.ssi.dk/Ekspertrapport%20Matematisk%20modellering%20COVID19%20smittespredning%20og%20sygehusbelastning%201604202) published on April 16th 2020

## SSEIH_model
This folder contains the model used for the [report](https://files.ssi.dk/Ekspertrapport-af-den-6-maj) published on May 6th 2020.
Updated to the code used for the report that was published on May 20th 2020.

## Contacts
This folder contains the code used to make the beta matrices for the SSEIH model. The work is based on contact matrices from the [BBC pandemic study] (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023754). Most of the code documents how the different (potential) openings of the Danish society are assumed to effect the number of contacts. It is worth noting that the SSEIH model samples values for beta around the values that are calculated in this script.
