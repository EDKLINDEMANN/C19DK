# SSEIH model

'SSEIH.R' contains the main code for running the model. It sources 'betasSSEIH.R' and 'inputsSSEIH.R'. 
'plotSSEIH.R' was used to create the plots for the [report published by SSI on May 6th 2020](https://files.ssi.dk/Ekspertrapport-af-den-6-maj).

The data for hospitalizations by region and age that is loaded as 'mdt' cannot be shared at this point. We have asked if can be shared and are awaiting the answer.
