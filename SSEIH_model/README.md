# SSEIH model

'SSEIH.R' contains the main code for running the model. It sources 'betasSSEIH.R' and 'inputsSSEIH.R'. 
'plotSSEIH.R' was used to create the plots for the [report published by SSI on May 6th 2020](https://files.ssi.dk/Ekspertrapport-af-den-6-maj).

### File "data_for_kaare2.csv" not available
The data for hospitalizations by region and age that is loaded as 'mdt' cannot be shared at this point. Sharing is pending legal clarification.
Meanwhile a file with the same structure is shared as "data_for_kaare_na.csv". All numbers are replaced by NAs.
